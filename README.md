# StopwatchApp
StopwatchApp is a SwiftUI application built using The Composable Architecture (TCA). The app is designed to track multiple activities, such as yoga, study, reading, and more, each with its own stopwatch profile.
Note: This project is currently a work in progress. The app now includes a basic stopwatch. The multi-profile and records features are under development.

## Features (Planned)
* Multiple stopwatch profiles: Track different activities separately (e.g., yoga, study, reading).
* Lap functionality: Record intermediate times for each session.
* Records tab: View all laps and final results before resetting a stopwatch.

## Current Functionality
* Single stopwatch with start/stop/reset capabilities.
